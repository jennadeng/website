            <h3>History of Myanmar</h3>
            <p>The Republic of the Union of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a
              sovereign state in Southeast Asia. With current population over 50 million
              and neighboring countries such as India, China, Thailand, Laos, and Bangladesh,
              Myanmar stands as one of the oldest and ancient countries.</p>
            <p>Although it was colonized by British and Japan centuries ago before
               the country received its independency, Myanmar tradition and culture
               were always well preserved all those years. Burmese cuisine is a fusion
               between Indian and Thai food flavors. However one of the most signature
               dish is Tea Leave Salad. Tea Leave is called “laphat” which plays a
               significant role in Myanmar society. Fermented tea leave is made best
               in the cold Northern mountain of Shan state region in Myanmar. Tea
               Leave salad is eaten best when paired with fried assorted beans and
               dried shrimp. It is also known to be an ancient symbolic peace offering
               between warring kingdoms. It is also traditionally provided at every
               house when visitors come. Now it can be found at any authentic Burmese restaurants.</p>
             <h3>About Beyond Burma</h3>
             <p>Beyond Burma was created with passion for food and inspiration to share
               Burmese culture in the most diverse city of San Francisco. When the founder
               came to US 18 years ago, she had only one thing in mind. It was to live
               American dream by running her own business and introducing delicious
               Burmese cuisine. Little did she knows, Burmese food was already popular
               and well liked by everyone who had tried in this city. However, she found
               that there was more demand than the supply and most restaurants and
               vendors keep it very traditional. So she and a business decided to create
               something more authentic but creative and add a twist to their fun menu.
               Now, BeyondBurma tasty food can be found at a restaurant in downtown SF
               and catering to locations all over the Bay Area.</p>
